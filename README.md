# -BRAYDEN-SMITH--Portfolio-README
<b>Brayden Smith | Senior Product Designer</b>

Hi there. You've landed on my GitHub, which for a designer, is a bit like finding a fish in a tree.

While I'm not a production developer, I have a deep technical fluency and extensive experience collaborating with engineering teams on their own turf. I've worked closely with developers on ASP.NET, MVC, and Blazor stacks, and I've used GitHub to manage design handoffs and version control for large-scale enterprise design systems.

My philosophy is that a designer who understands the technical framework can create solutions that are not only more elegant but also more feasible, scalable, and accessible.

My primary portfolio, which showcases my case studies, high-fidelity prototypes, and final design work, is available at:

What I Do

-UX/UI Design: Leading end-to-end design for complex, data-heavy applications.

-Accessibility: Building WCAG (AAA) and Section 508 compliant experiences.

-Design Systems: Creating and stewarding large-scale, enterprise-ready systems in Figma.

-Data Visualization: Designing intuitive, accessible dashboards and reports for BI users.
